## Generate configuration from template

### Index

- [Step 1. Write Quick Start Configuration](#Quick)
- [Step 2. Generate OpenPAI configuration files](#Generate)
- [Optional Step 3. Customize configure OpenPAI](#Customize)




### Step 1. Write Quick start <a name="Generate"></a>

There is a example file in the [link](./../../../deployment/quick-start/quick-start-example.yaml) .

An example yaml file is shown below. Note that you should change the IP address of the machine and ssh information accordingly.

```YAML
# quick-start.yaml

# (Required) Please fill in the IP address of the server you would like to deploy OpenPAI
machines:
  - 192.168.1.11
  - 192.168.1.12
  - 192.168.1.13

# (Required) Log-in info of all machines. System administrator should guarantee
# that the username/password pair or username/key-filename is valid and has sudo privilege.
ssh-username: pai
ssh-password: pai-password

# (Optional, default=None) the key file that ssh client uses, that has higher priority then password.
#ssh-keyfile-path: <keyfile-path>

# (Optional, default=22) Port number of ssh service on each machine.
#ssh-port: 22

# (Optional, default=DNS of the first machine) Cluster DNS.
#dns: <ip-of-dns>

# (Optional, default=10.254.0.0/16) IP range used by Kubernetes. Note that
# this IP range should NOT conflict with the current network.
#service-cluster-ip-range: <ip-range-for-k8s>
```

### Step 2. Generate OpenPAI configuration files <a name="Generate"></a>

##### (1) generate configuration files

```bash
cd /pai

# cmd should be executed under pai directory in the dev-box.

python paictl.py config generate -i /pai/deployment/quick-start/quick-start.yaml -o ~/pai-config -f
```

##### (2) update docker tag to release version

```bash
vi ~/pai-config/services-configuration.yaml
```
For example: v0.x.y branch, user should change docker-tag to v0.x.y.
```bash
docker-tag: v0.x.y
```

##### (3) changing gpu count and type

Quick start will generate node with 1 gpu with type generic, this may not suit your situation, for example, if you have two types of machines, and one type has 4 Tesla K80 gpu cards, and another has 2 Tesla P100 cards, you should modify your ~/pai-config/cluster-configuration.yaml as following:

```YAML
machine-sku:
  k80-node:
    mem: 40G
    gpu:
      type: Tesla K80
      count: 4
    cpu:
      vcore: 24
    os: ubuntu16.04
  p100-node:
    mem: 20G
    gpu:
      type: Tesla P100
      count: 2
    cpu:
      vcore: 24
    os: ubuntu16.04

machine-list:
  - hostname: xxx
    hostip: yyy
    machine-type: k80-node
  - hostname: xxx
    hostip: yyy
    machine-type: p100-node
```

##### (4) The default value in the generated configuration 
The `paictl` tool sets the following default values in the 4 configuration files:

| Configuration Property | Default value |
| --- | --- |
| ```master node``` | The first machine in the machine list will be configured as the master node. |
| ```SSH port``` | If not explicitly specified, the SSH port is set to `22`. |
| ```cluster DNS``` | If not explicitly specified, the cluster DNS is set to the value of the `nameserver` field in `/etc/resolv.conf` file of the master node. |
| ```IP range used by Kubernetes``` | If not explicitly specified, the IP range used by Kubernetes is set to `10.254.0.0/16`. |
| ```docker registry``` | The docker registry is set to `docker.io`, and the docker namespace is set to `openpai`. In another word, all PAI service images will be pulled from `docker.io/openpai` (see [this link](https://hub.docker.com/r/openpai/) on DockerHub for the details of all images). |
| ```Cluster id``` | Cluster id is set to `pai-example` |
| ```REST server's admin user``` | REST server's admin user is set to `admin`, and its password is set to `admin-password` |
| ```VC``` | There is only one VC in the system, `default`, which has 100% of the resource capacity. |  

### Optional Step 3. Customize configure OpenPAI <a name="Customize"></a>
This method is for advanced users.

The description of each field in these configuration files can be found in [A Guide For Cluster Configuration](./customized-configuration.md).

If user want to customize configuration, please see the table below
- Configure OpenPAI from scenarios
    - placement
      - [configure node placement of service](./how-to-configure-cluster-configuraiton.md#machineList)
      - [configure install gpu driver on which server](./how-to-configure-cluster-configuraiton.md#gpu_driver)
    - scheduling
      - [configure virtual cluster capacity](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#configure_vc_capacity)
    - account
      - [configure customize docker repository](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#ref_cluster_config)
      - [configure OpenPAI admin user account](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#ref_rest_server)
    - port / data folder etc.
      - [configure service entry](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#optional)
      - [configure HDFS data / OpenPAI temp data folder](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#ref_cluster_config)
    - component version
      - [configure K8s component version](./how-to-configure-k8s-config.md#kubernetes)
      - [configure nvidia gpu driver version](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#ref_drivers)
    - HA
      - [Kubernetes High Availability Configuration](./kubernetes-ha.md)

- [Configure OpenPAI from files](./customized-configuration.md)
  - Cluster related configuration: [configuration of cluster-configuration.yaml](./how-to-configure-cluster-configuraiton.md)
  - Kubernetes role related configuration: It will be deprecated
  - Kubernetes related configuration: [configuration of kubernetes-configuration.yaml](./how-to-configure-k8s-config.md)
  - Service related configuration: [configuration of services-configuration.yaml](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md)

- [Configure OpenPAI services](./how-to-congiure-service-config.md#optional) [Note: This part is for advanced user who wants to customize OpenPAI each service]
