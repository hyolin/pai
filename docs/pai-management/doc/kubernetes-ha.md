### ```Deploy Kubernetes on a Single Master Node (without HA)```

Single master mode does not have high availability.

- Only set one node's k8s-role as master
- Set this field ```load-balance-ip``` to your master's ip address

### ```Kubernetes with High Availability: The `proxy` Role```

There are 3 roles in [k8s-role-definition](../../../examples/cluster-configuration/k8s-role-definition.yaml). The ```master``` will start a k8s-master component on the specified machine. And the ```proxy``` will start a proxy component on the specified machine. In cluster-configuration.yaml,

- One or more than one nodes are labeled with ```k8s-role: master```
- One node should be labeled with ```k8s-role: proxy```
- Set the field ```load-balance-ip``` to your proxy node's ip address

Node: the proxy node itself is not in ha mode. How to configure the proxy node in ha mode is out of the scope of PAI deployment.

### ```Kubernetes with High Availability: External Load Balancer```

If your cluster has a reliable load-balance server (e.g. in a cloud environment such as Azure), you could set up a load-balancer and set the field ```load-balance-ip``` in the kubernetes-configuration.yaml to the load-balancer.

- Set the field ```load-balance-ip`` to the ip-address of your load-balancer.
