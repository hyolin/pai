#### Overview <a name="overview"></a>

PAI configuration consists of 4 YAML files:

- [`cluster-configuration.yaml`](../../../examples/cluster-configuration/cluster-configuration.yaml) - Machine-level configurations. This file contains basic configurations of cluster, such as the login info, machine SKUs, labels of each machine, etc.
- [`kubernetes-configuration.yaml`](../../../examples/cluster-configuration/kubernetes-configuration.yaml) - Kubernetes-level configurations. This file contains basic configurations of Kubernetes, such as the version info, network configurations, etc.
- [`k8s-role-definition.yaml`](../../../examples/cluster-configuration/k8s-role-definition.yaml) - Kubernetes-level configurations. This file contains the mappings of Kubernetes roles and machine labels. It will be deprecated in the future.
- [`serivices-configuration.yaml`](../../../examples/cluster-configuration/services-configuration.yaml) - Service-level configurations. This file contains the definitions of cluster id, docker registry, and those of all individual PAI services.
