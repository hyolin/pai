## Update Configuration

After the kubernetes cluster is setup, and before managing your cluster and service, you should upload the cluster configuration into the kubernetes cluster with the following command.

### Index

- [Push Cluster Configuration](#push_cfg)
- [Reference](#refer)

### Update Cluster Configuration <a name="push_cfg"></a>

- [Option A. From local disk](#local_disk)
- [Option B. From an external git repo](#git_repo)


If your cluster configuration is managed and stored in a host path, you could choose the Option A to update the configuration into the cluster.

If your cluster configuration is managed and stored at a git repo, you could choose the Option B to sync the configuration directly from git repo to cluster.

#### ```Option A. From local disk``` <a name="local_disk"></a>
```bash
python paictl.py config push -p /path/to/config/dir [-c ~/.kube/config]
```


#### ```Option B. From an external git repo``` <a name="git_repo"></a>

- First please write an external storage configuration. 
```YAML
#################
#     Git       #
#################

type: git
url: https://github.com/microsoft/pai.git
branch: branch_name
path: path_in_repo
```

Note: You should do it at the first time to update configuraiton from git repo to the cluster. If you have done this steps before, you could skip it.


- Then, update this external storage configuration into kubernetes cluster with the following command.

```bash
python paictl.py config external-config-update -e external-config-path [ -c ~/.kube/config ]
```

- At last, execute the update command following

```
python paictl.py config push [-c ~/.kube/config]
```


If this the first time that you upload configuration, a ```cluster-id``` will be asked to type. The cluster-id is used to manage this cluster.

What if you forget the cluster-id? Please refer to the [link](../../paictl/paictl-manual.md#Config_Id) in the pacitl manual book.
