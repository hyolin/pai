## Deploy kubernetes cluster with OpenPAI


#### Prerequires

Before deploying kubernete with OpenPAI, please be sure that your hardware and os meet the requirement in the [link](../../../README.md#ref_prerequisites) 


#### Command

```bash
cd pai

python paictl.py cluster k8s-bootup \
  -p ~/pai-config
```

The `paictl` tool does the following things:

- Install `kubectl` command in the current machine (or the dev-box).

- Generate Kubernetes-related configuration files based on `cluster-configuration.yaml`, `kubernetes-configuration.yaml` and `k8s-role-definition.yaml`.

- Use `kubectl` to boot up Kubernetes on target machines.


#### How to check <a name="ref_check"></a>

After this step, the system maintainer can check the status of Kubernetes by accessing Kubernetes Dashboard:

```
http://<master>:9090
```

Where `<master>` denotes the IP address of the load balancer of Kubernetes master nodes. When there is only one master node and a load balancer is not used, it is usually the IP address of the master node itself.
